# Beware-the-Hurricane
my first data analysis project on 34 most devastating hurricanes
It is a project i did through codecademy.
In the project I organize the data in a more readable way and extract some key information like the area hit most by hurricanes. Spoiler alert..its Central America which suffered
9 hurricanes!!
The code quality isn't all too pleasing to the experienced eye. It might make some scream lol! But I feel happy I was able to complete the project using everything I learnt.
I am a completely self-taught programmer who is in love with data and I am now trying to tame the mighty computer to do as I command.I guess that's why it's called the
command line(terrible attempt at a joke)
